# ML-vs-Classical-Statistics-in-Finance

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository is a structured knowledge base comparing **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Classical Statistical** methods across multiple financial modeling tasks.  

For each **task**, we:
1. Define the problem and objectives
2. Document **Classical Baselines** and **ML Approaches**
3. Compare methods side-by-side for the same problem
4. Review relevant literature
5. Write a final **Decision Memo** with conclusions and recommendations

## ðŸ“‘ File Format for Method Analysis
Each `.md` file inside `02_classical-baselines` and `03_ml-approaches` follows this structure:

Problem & Objective

Briefly describe the problem and its role in finance.

Baselines

List the baseline models/approaches.

Strengths

List of advantages.

Limitations

List of drawbacks or challenges.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Literature Review (First Step)**  
   - Search and collect all relevant literature for the current task  
   - Document each paper in the `literature-review` folder with:
     - Title, authors, year
     - Problem addressed
     - Method summary
     - Results summary
     - Strengths & weaknesses
   - Ensure coverage of both **Classical** and **ML** approaches

2. **Per-Problem Documentation**  
   - Classify methods by specific problem under the task (e.g., Risk Premium, Portfolio Optimization)  
   - For each problem, write in the corresponding `.md` file under:
     - `02_classical-baselines` (for Classical approaches)  
     - `03_ml-approaches` (for ML approaches)  
   - Follow the template:
     ```
     ## Problem & Objective
     ## Baselines
     ## Strengths
     ## Limitations
     ```

3. **Comparison**  
   - Summarize findings for each problem in `04_classic-vs-ml_comparison.md`  
   - Highlight similarities, differences, advantages, limitations, and applicable scenarios

4. **Decision Memo (Final Step)**  
   - After all problems for the task are documented and compared, write
   - `00_overviwe.md`, `01_evaluation-metrics.md`,`05_decision-memo.md`  
   - Provide:
     - Overall conclusions for the task
     - Recommended approaches
     - Future research opportunities
